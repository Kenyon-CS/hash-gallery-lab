# Hashing Lab: Gallery Exhibition Subproblems (3 Projects)

This repository contains three small C++17 starter projects.
Each project uses hashing for a different algorithmic purpose:

1. `01-layout-dedup`    — Hashing for **state deduplication** (avoid repeated layouts)
2. `02-conflict-check`  — Hashing for **O(1) constraint checking** during placement
3. `03-load-balance`    — Hashing as **randomized assignment** (balls into bins)

## Build
Each project is self-contained:

    cd 01-layout-dedup && make
    cd 02-conflict-check && make
    cd 03-load-balance && make

## Notes
- These are frameworks, not full solutions.
- Each README contains student tasks and extension ideas.
- Data files include:
  - small (debug) inputs
  - larger (stress) inputs
